"Welcome to ZOMBIEGAME! It's aptly name because (you guessed it) it's
a game about zombies! You grew tired of a boring job and decided to
turn to purging the undead from our society. You've been tasked by
your secret order to eliminate all undead creatures from this mansion.
Here's some good news: items from previous hunters are scattered 
throughout the house, and it's said that if the head Boss is taken
out, all his underlings will die too. Super convenient! Now... how to
survive long enough to make it upstairs to the Boss...?"

These items have been added to the Zombie Game by Beth Ann Townsend 
and James Lawson:

1. Scoring
	We have added a scoring system to the game to add a more 
	competitive aspect. Now you can not only see how long you
	last, but compare it with your past scores or those of your
	friends! Each monster you encounter has a point amount
	attached to them. Defeating them (running into them) will 
	award you the points. But don't get too distracted by your 
	score and forget about your health!

2. New Room Objects
	Now, a room can contain the following items: a stairwell
	leading up, one leading down, a spike, and a pitfall. The 
	icons, respectively, are "^", "v", "X", and "O", and a 
	collision of the hero with these will result in the 
	corresponding action. The stairs lead you "up" or "down" a 
	level, and a pitfall drops entities down a level (except the 
	Boss, since he is too big to fall through) and deducts health,
        pulling from the provided rooms files. 
	
	As would make sense, the highest room does not have an upward 
	stairwell, the lowest does not have a downward stairwell nor 
	a pitfall, and, lastly, the stairs correspond with one 
	another. There may be zombies shambling around this building, 
	but it still follows the physical laws of any other structure. 
	If you fall down a level, your hitpoints will decrease 
	according to how hard you hit the ground.
	
	For the spikes, which the zombies set up for meager defense
	(they're not that smart), they cause damage to a colliding 
	entity, including your opponents. Use these and pitfalls to
	strategically remove enemies!

3. Room Loading
	As mentioned above, there is the new capability of loading
	custom rooms from text files that follow the game's character
	key. The order of the rooms (lowest to highest) follows the 
	alphabetical order of the file names (lowest to highest). The
	last room--the boss room--will spawn only monsters, including
	the final boss. This is for only the bravest of heroes! Tread
	carefully here.

4. New Monsters
	In the final boss's lair, there obviously needs to dwell the 
	biggest baddie of all: Boss Skellington. AKA "B." He's lean, 
	he's mean, he's an arrow-shooting machine--but he's also 
	pretty slow. Try taking down this tank while avoiding his 
	attacks, both ranged (with his bow and arrow) and melee 
	(the shin-bone sword). If you succeed, you win!

	Additionally, we created a baby zombie. It can easily be 
	killed since it's so small--such a sweet little "z"--and it
	can hardly attack under normal circumstances. They're more 
	annoying than anything, always getting in your way... kind of 
	like real kids. However, if the baby begins to cry, watch out!
	Its attack points increase dramatically because no one likes 
	to hear the wailing of a baby, especially that of a zombie, 
	and for you it brings back suppressed memories of your job at 
	that daycare before you turned to zombie-hunting. 

5. New Items
	Besides health packs, intrepid adventurers before you have
	left behind items such as shields, or even UndeadRepellent©.
	(Not sponsored by UndeadRepellent & Co.) The shields have a 
	durability rating depending on how much action they have seen
	in the past, and so for the next few rounds determined by the
	durability rating (a rating of 1 = 1 rounds, a 5 = 5 rounds,
	etc.), you are invincible! Good thing you practiced defense
	a lot back in your rookie training days. Now you're a beast 
	with the shield, and nothing can stop you!

	The UndeadRepellent© burns all undead creatures in a 3x3 area
	around you. Throw the bottle on the ground (hit the spacebar) 
	to activate its splashing damage and watch as the children of
	the night burn. What sweet music they make.
